|Please don't see just a bo| y caught up in dreams and fantasies.|
|**Famj7**|**Famj7**|
|Please see me |reaching out for someone I can see. Take my |
|**Em**|**Famj7**|
|hand let's see where we wake up to|morrow. Best laid |
|**Em**|**Famj7**|
|plans sometimes it's just a one night|stand. I'd be |
|**Em**|**Famj7**|
|damned Cupid's demanding back his |arrow. So let's get|
|**G**|**G7**|
| drunk on |our tears and|
|**Famj7**|**C**|
|God, tell us the |reason youth is wasted on the|
|**Famj7**|**C**|
|young? It's hunting| season and the lambs are on the|
|**Famj7**|**Em**|
|run, Searching for |meaning. But are we|
|**D**|**D**|
|all lost |stars, trying to |
|**Dm**|**Gsus4/G**|
|light up the |dark?|
|================================|==================================|
|**Famj7**|**Famj7**|
|Who are we? Just a |spec of dust within the galaxy.|
|**Famj7**|**Famj7**|
|Woe is me |if we're not careful turns into reality. Don't you|
|**Em**|**Famj7**|
|dare let all these memories bring you |sorrow? Yester|
|**Em**|**Famj7**|
|-day I saw a lion kiss a |deer. Turn the page |
|**Em**|**Famj7**|
|maybe we'll find a brand new |ending. Where we're |
|**G**|**G7**|
|dancing in |our tears and|
|**Famj7**|**C**|
|God, tell us the |reason youth is wasted on the|
|**Famj7**|**C**|

|light up the |dark?|
|================================|==================================|
|**Famj7**|**C**|
|I thought I saw you out there |crying.|
|**Famj7**|**C**|
|I thought I heard you call my |name.|
|**Famj7**|**C**|
|I thought I saw you out there |crying. Just the|
|**G**|**G7**|
|same| |
